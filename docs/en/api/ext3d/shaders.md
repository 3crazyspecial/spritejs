## Build-in shaders

As follows:

- NORMAL A simple shader to determine the surface color according to the normal vector, mainly used for testing.
- NORMAL_GEOMETRY A general shader supporting illumination and surface color, which can be used by general geometric elements.
- NORMAL_TEXTURE A general shader supporting illumination and texture, which can be used by geometric elements with texture.
- GEOMETRY_WITH_TEXTURE A general shader that supports lighting, surface color, and texture, which can be used by geometric elements of translucent textures.
- GEOMETRY_WITH_SHADOW A general shader that support lighting, surface color, and shadow.
- TEXTURE_WITH_SHADOW A general shader that support lighting, texture, and shadow.
- GEOMETRY_WITH_TEXTURE_AND_SHADOW A general shader that support light, surface color, texture, and shadow.
- TEXTURE_CUBE A general shader with cube texture support.
